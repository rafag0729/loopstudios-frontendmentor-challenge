The challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focused mostly on HTML & CSS. There's was tiny bit of ReactJS included for the mobile navigation toggle and also for showing images depending on the viewport size. 

The users will be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
